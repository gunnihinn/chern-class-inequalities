Higher Chern class inequalities
===============================

* Description of the project and progress so far

This is an attempt to find inequalities between Chern classes on complex
manifolds. The basic inequality we model our efforts on is the
Kobayashi-Lubke inequality for Hermite-Einstein vector bundles.

The first step in this attempt was to reprove the Kobayashi-Lubke
inequality using coordinate-invariant notation. The "new" proof is very
probably the same as the original one if we write everything in a given
basis; we just calculate the square of the norm of a curvature tensor on
the given bundle and combine the result with a version of the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

To do this we viewed the curvature form of a vector bundle as a (2,2)-form
on the total space of the bundle. Then it was necessary to work out how to
express the square of the norm of a (p,p)-form on a complex vector space in
terms of its traces against the Kahler form of the inner product. Such an
expression is well-known for a (1,1)-form but I don't think it had already
been worked out for higher-degree forms.

The next step is to try to find similar inequalities involving higher Chern
classes. The calculations here are intimidating and we may need to
specialize to the case of Kahler-Einstein manifolds to get anything useful.

Anyone is free to contribute to this project. I'll play the role of a
benevolent dictator/editor, but if this work abuts to anything noteworthy
then everyone who contributed will be credited in the final result and
involved in publishing it to the world, possibly exploding the "author"
field in the LaTeX file.
